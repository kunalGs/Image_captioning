Image Captioning project using CNN-LSTM system in pytorch

# Image Captioning:
## 1. Design a CNN-LSTM system (preferably in pytroch) that can perform image captioning [System 1] based on the following details
• You are free to decide the CNN and LSTM architecture that best suits your case. The objective is to achieve a good BLEU score on the test set of Flickr8K data .
• Use the Flickr8K data for training and testing the model.

## 2. The LSTM based image captioning can ‘blindly’ learn the structure of the language and predict meaningful sentences even with out learning much insight to the content of the image. This is termed as “language bias” of the system.

# Design a training experiment with Flickr8K data to assess the language bias of your CNN-LSTM system [System 1 Modified]. Provide objective and subjective analysis/comparison of the results of System 1 and System 1 Modified .
